# QUESTION 1:

## i
One enduring objection is the "Argument from Consciousness," which posits that machines, regardless of their behavior, cannot possess consciousness or self-awareness. This argument suggests that without subjective experiences, machines cannot truly "think." The distinction between simulating understanding and actual consciousness remains a significant philosophical debate in artificial intelligence.

## ii:

Turing anticipated the "Argument from Consciousness" and countered it by suggesting that if a machine's responses are indistinguishable from a human's, we should attribute intelligence to the machine. However, critics argue that behavioral equivalence doesn't necessarily imply genuine understanding or consciousness. While Turing's refutation addresses functional behavior, it doesn't fully resolve concerns about subjective experience.

## iii:

⭕ Ethical and Moral Considerations: The integration of AI into various aspects of society raises questions about moral responsibility, decision-making biases, and the potential for AI to cause harm.

⭕ The "Chinese Room" Argument: Proposed by philosopher John Searle, this thought experiment argues that a machine processing symbols based on rules (like a computer) doesn't understand their meaning, challenging the notion that passing the Turing Test equates to true understanding.

⭕ AI and Employment: The potential for AI to replace human jobs has become a significant concern, raising questions about the societal and economic impacts of intelligent machines.

## iv:

Turing predicted that by the year 2000, machines would have a 30% chance of fooling an average interrogator after five minutes of questioning. While early AI systems did not meet this benchmark, advancements in natural language processing and machine learning have brought us closer to this reality. For instance, AI models like GPT-3 have demonstrated the ability to generate human-like text, occasionally convincing users of their human-like capabilities. However, these models still lack true understanding and consciousness, operating based on pattern recognition rather than genuine comprehension.
